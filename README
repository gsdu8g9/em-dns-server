A simple dns server using eventmachine.  It is pretty bare bones and is probably not very useful.

required gems:
  daemons
  eventmachine
  dnsruby
  geoip

usage:

  1) download http://geolite.maxmind.com/download/geoip/database/GeoLiteCity.dat.gz into the base directory and unzip it
  2) ./bin/em-dns-server start

test:

  dig @nameserver.com example.com

  response will change based on the clients location
