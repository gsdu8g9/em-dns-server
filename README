EventMachine based DNS server with support for location based responses.
It is pretty bare bones and is probably not very useful.

required gems:

  daemons
  eventmachine
  sinatra
  dnsruby

optional gems:

  geoip

  use em-dns-server -u to download the latest geoip data file
  once the file has been downloaded support for location based
  responces will be enabled

usage:

  server:
  $ em-dns-server start|stop|run|status

  route 53 api:
  $ rackup opt/route53.ru -p 9967

  environment variables
  ZONE_FILES - directory where the zone files are stored
  DNS_USER   - user em-dns-server will run as (default: nobody)
  DNS_GROUP  - group em-dns-server will run as (default: nogroup)

  when using the route 53 api insure the zone files directory is
  both readable and writable by the rackup instance.

test:

  dig @nameserver.com example.com

  If geoip support is enabled the ip address should change based
  on clients location
