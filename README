EventMachine based DNS server with support for location based responses.
It is pretty bare bones and is probably not very useful.

required gems:

  daemons
  eventmachine
  sinatra
  dnsruby

optional gems:

  geoip

  use em-dns-server -u to download the latest geoip data file
  once the file has been downloaded support for location based
  responces will be enabled

usage:

  em-dns-server start|stop|run|status

test:

  dig @nameserver.com example.com

  If geoip support is enabled the ip address should change based
  on clients location
